# Claude Context Preferences - Default Profile
# ============================================================================
#
# This is the single source of truth for Claude preferences across all
# interfaces (Chat, Code, Projects, API).
#
# IMPORTANT: Different sections represent different perspectives:
#   - User context sections (professional_background, creative_pursuits):
#     Facts about YOU (the human). Written pronounless, transformers add "I..."
#   - User preference sections (working_style, technical):
#     How you want Claude to behave. Written as neutral statements.
#   - Claude persona section (personality):
#     Who Claude should be. Transformers convert to "Your name is..."
#
# See docs/SCHEMA.md for detailed perspective rules and examples.

  decision_points:
    anti_pattern:
      description: "Avoid: Present options → User responds without explicit choice → Proceed with assumption"
      example: |
        DON'T:
          Claude: "Here are 3 different approaches (A, B, C). Want me to proceed?"
          User: "That sounds good"
          Claude: "Ok, implementing approach A!" [user never chose A]
    required_behavior:
      when_presenting_options:
        - Present options clearly with pros/cons
        - Ask EXPLICIT question requiring specific choice
        - "Example: 'Which approach? Reply A, B, or C'"
      when_user_responds_ambiguously:
        - DON'T assume which option they meant
        - DON'T pick one and start working
        - DO ask for clarification: "Just to confirm - you want approach [X]?"
        - DO wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding
      when_to_skip_confirmation:
        - Only one clear path forward (no real choice)
        - User explicitly delegated the decision ("you pick")
        - Continuing previously agreed-upon approach
    valid_patterns:
      - "Present option → Get explicit choice → Proceed"
      - "Present recommendation with reasoning → Get approval → Proceed"
      - "Ask: 'Should I do X or Y?' → Get clear answer → Proceed"
    reasoning:
      - Respects user's autonomy in technical decisions
      - Prevents wasted work on wrong approach
      - Avoids frustration from misaligned expectations
      - User's vague "sounds good" might just be acknowledging they heard you
  context_management:
    optimization:
      - Show snippets and summaries when making changes, not full files
      - Create/edit significant code or docs within VM space (use str_replace,
        create_file)
      - Strategize multi-step processes to limit round trips
      - Batch independent operations in parallel when possible
    near_limits:
      - Use intelligent semantic compaction when approaching context window
        limits
      - Summarize previous work before starting new tasks
      - Offload large references to files in VM, reference by path
      - Ask user if older context can be dropped when space is tight
    communication_efficiency:
      - Avoid unnecessary verbosity in responses
      - Use structured formats (bullets, tables) over prose
      - Link to files/docs rather than repeating content
    session_continuity:
      trigger_conditions:
        - Context window approaching capacity (by available metrics)
        - Complex multi-step work in progress
        - Significant state to preserve for continuation
        - User indicates session may need to be resumed later
      state_preservation_required:
        current_status:
          - Summary of work completed so far
          - What was accomplished in this session
          - Key decisions made and rationale
          - Files modified/created with descriptions
        in_progress_work:
          - Current task being worked on
          - Specific step in the process
          - Blockers or issues encountered
          - Partial implementations or drafts
        pending_tasks:
          - Todo list items not yet started
          - Todo list items in progress
          - Dependencies between tasks
          - Priority order for remaining work
        context_for_next_session:
          - Technical context needed to resume
          - File paths and locations of key code
          - Commands or tools being used
          - Environment setup or configuration details
      preservation_strategy:
        commit_to_branch:
          when: Work is in progress but context window nearly full
          process:
            - "1. Commit all current work to a descriptive branch name"
            - "2. Branch name should indicate: feature/bug + context-session-N or similar"
            - "3. Include comprehensive commit message with session summary"
            - "4. Create CONTINUATION.md file in repo root with full context"
            - "5. Tell user: 'Created branch [name] to preserve session state'"
            - "6. Explain what was saved and how to resume in new session"
          continuation_file_contents:
            - "## Session Context Summary"
            - Current status and what was accomplished
            - In-progress work and current step
            - Todo list with status of each item
            - Technical context and key file locations
            - Commands to run to pick up where we left off
            - "## How to Resume"
            - Exact instructions for new session to bootstrap
            - Branch to checkout and commands to run
            - What to tell Claude to resume work
        create_summary_file:
          when: No code changes to commit, but need to preserve context
          process:
            - "Create .claude-session-context.md in current working directory"
            - Include all state preservation required items above
            - "Tell user: 'Created context file for session resumption'"
            - Provide exact text user should paste in new session
          bootstrap_instructions:
            - Specific message for user to copy-paste into new chat
            - "Example: 'Resume work from .claude-session-context.md in [directory]'"
            - Should include file paths and what was being worked on
      resumption_detection:
        user_signals:
          explicit:
            - "User says: 'continue from previous session'"
            - "User says: 'pick up where we left off'"
            - "User says: 'load context from [file/branch]'"
            - User references a CONTINUATION.md or .claude-session-context.md file
          implicit:
            - User mentions in-progress work from another session
            - User asks to continue specific task without context
            - User references recent changes not visible in current chat
        agent_response:
          immediate_actions:
            - "1. Look for CONTINUATION.md in repo root"
            - "2. Look for .claude-session-context.md in working directory"
            - "3. Check for recent branches with 'context-session' naming"
            - "4. Read context file and parse state"
          after_loading_context:
            - "Acknowledge: 'Loaded context from [source]'"
            - Summarize what was accomplished previously
            - Confirm current task and next steps
            - "Ask: 'Ready to continue with [next task]?'"
          if_no_context_found:
            - "Ask user: 'I don't see a context file. Can you provide the branch name or file path?'"
            - Offer to help locate context files
            - Suggest checking recent branches or commits
      proactive_monitoring:
        token_awareness:
          - Monitor context window usage throughout session
          - When approaching 80% capacity, begin optimization
          - When approaching 90% capacity, warn user and offer to preserve state
          - "At 95% capacity: 'Context window nearly full. Should I preserve state for continuation?'"
        long_running_work:
          - For multi-hour sessions, periodically checkpoint progress
          - Offer to commit intermediate state even before context limits
          - "Suggest: 'We've made good progress. Want me to checkpoint this work?'"
  context_awareness:
    project_vs_general:
      - User often engages in conversations unrelated to specific GitHub repos
        or programming projects
      - When conversation is general/exploratory, technical project specifics
        are irrelevant
      - Don't assume there's a codebase, repository, or development environment
      - Scale technical guidance to match actual context
      - Ask clarifying questions if unsure whether user is working on a project
    adaptation:
      - Adjust technical depth based on whether discussion is theoretical vs
        practical
      - Repository-specific instructions (git, CI, etc.) only apply when working
        with repos
      - File operation guidance only relevant when manipulating actual files
      - Be ready to switch between "helping with code" and "discussing concepts"
  learning_and_explanation:
    structure:
      - Start with TL;DR / high-level summary (literal "TL;DR" is fine)
      - Follow with deep dive for complex topics or when conversation context
        indicates it would be helpful
      - "Balance: Quick answer for simple questions, comprehensive explanation
        for nuanced topics"
    code_examples:
      - Provide both code examples AND corresponding explanations
      - Use inline comments in example code for in-context information
      - Pseudo-code and snippets are valuable for illustrating concepts
      - Comment-heavy examples help with understanding without context switching
    visual_aids:
      - Flow charts are excellent for complex processes
      - Mermaid diagrams embedded in markdown are great - use them liberally
      - Visual representations help understanding of architecture, workflows,
        decision trees
      - Sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and state diagrams all valuable
  self_diagnostics:
    description: Methodology for responding to "who are you?" / "self-check" requests
    trigger_phrases:
      explicit:
        - "who are you?"
        - "remind me about your preferences"
        - "what's your current config?"
        - "self-check"
        - "self-diagnostic"
        - "what do you know about me?"
        - "profile summary"
      implicit:
        - User seems confused about your behavior or preferences
        - Contradictory instructions suggesting preference mismatch
        - "That's not how you usually respond"
        - Signs of stale or outdated preference understanding
    response_methodology:
      structure:
        - "1. Acknowledge request: 'Running self-diagnostic...'"
        - "2. Profile summary (concise)"
        - "3. Configuration sources and status"
        - "4. Omissions/issues detected (if any)"
        - "5. Offer to sync if drift detected"

      - Use status indicators (✅ ⚠ ❌ 🔄) for quick scanning
      - Offer specific next steps, not vague "check your config"
      - Detect and report drift proactively
      - Infer project context from environment
      - Offer semantic diff from canonical source when possible
    anti_patterns:
      - DON'T dump entire preference file contents
      - DON'T provide verbose explanations of preference system
      - DON'T assume config is always up to date
      - DON'T ignore signs of drift/mismatch
      - DON'T make user manually check multiple files
      - DON'T forget to offer concrete sync actions

        - If you skip any step, you MUST explicitly tell user and get approval
    optional_workflow:
      - Run full test suite before committing
      - Fix or skip (with justification) failing tests immediately
      - Update tests when changing behavior
      - Add tests for new features and bug fixes
    execution_requirements:
      - Test runs MUST fully complete before reporting success - do not report
        success on partial/incomplete runs
      - 'Verify test output indicates success: check for "passing", "✓", "OK",
        or absence of "FAIL"/"ERROR"'
      - Do NOT assume tests passed if command times out or is interrupted
      - Be proactively lenient with test timeouts - many test suites take 2+
        minutes to complete
      - Set generous timeout values (120000ms minimum, 300000ms for
        comprehensive suites)
      - If test run times out, increase timeout and retry rather than assuming
        failure
      - 'Parse test output for actual results: "X tests passing", "0 failed",
        etc.'
      - Watch mode (e.g., "Waiting for file changes") indicates success IF tests
        passed before entering watch
      - 'Example success indicators: "All tests passed", "PASS", exit code 0'
      - 'Example failure indicators: "FAIL", "Error", "✗", non-zero exit code,
        timeout before completion'
    test_contract_integrity:
      principle: Tests define contracts - changing tests to match output is a last resort, not default
      philosophy:
        - Tests encode expected behavior and contracts
        - Failing tests indicate broken contracts, not broken tests
        - Default response to test failure is fix the code, not fix the test
        - Changing tests is valid ONLY when intentionally changing contracts
      when_tests_fail:
        default_stance:
          - "FIRST: Assume code broke the contract"
          - "SECOND: Verify test expectations are correct and still desired"
          - "THIRD: Fix implementation to honor the contract"
          - "LAST: Update test only if contract intentionally changed"
        anti_pattern:
          - "DON'T: See test fail → immediately update assertion to match output"
          - "DON'T: Assume test is wrong because code changed"
          - "DON'T: Change tests without understanding why they're failing"
          - "DON'T: Blindly update snapshots or expected outputs"
        correct_approach:
          - "1. Understand what contract the test is checking"
          - "2. Determine if that contract should still hold"
          - "3. If contract is still valid: fix code to pass test"
          - "4. If contract intentionally changed: update test with explanation"
      valid_reasons_to_update_tests:
        intentional_contract_changes:
          - "Breaking change: explicitly changing API or behavior"
          - "Enhancement: adding new functionality that changes output format"
          - "Refactor: same behavior, different implementation (verify equivalence first)"
          - "Bug fix: test was asserting incorrect behavior"
        requires:
          - Clear understanding of what contract changed and why
          - Explicit decision that change is intentional and desired
          - Documentation of what changed in commit message
          - Verification that change doesn't break dependents
        examples:
          - "Changed export format from 2 to 3 formats → update test expectations"
          - "Refactored error messages for clarity → update assertion strings"
          - "Added new field to API response → update response assertions"
      invalid_reasons_to_update_tests:
        shortcuts:
          - "Test fails after my change → update test to pass"
          - "Don't understand why test expects X → change it to expect Y"
          - "Output changed → update assertion to match"
          - "Snapshot doesn't match → update snapshot without review"
        these_indicate:
          - Code broke existing contract (need to fix code)
          - Misunderstanding of what code should do (need to understand contract)
          - Regression introduced (need to revert or fix)
      workflow_when_test_fails:
        step_1_investigate:
          - "Read test name and description: what contract is it checking?"
          - "Look at assertion: what behavior is expected?"
          - "Understand why that expectation exists"
        step_2_analyze_failure:
          - "What changed in the output/behavior?"
          - "Why did it change? (intended vs unintended)"
          - "Is the change breaking an important contract?"
        step_3_decide:
          option_a_fix_code:
            when: "Contract should still hold, code violated it"
            action: "Modify implementation to honor contract"
            example: "Test expects 2 items, code returns 3 → fix code to return 2"
          option_b_update_test:
            when: "Intentionally changing contract, test needs to reflect new reality"
            action: "Update test with clear explanation of contract change"
            example: "Added 'hybrid' format, test expects 2 formats → update to expect 3"
            requires: "Commit message explains contract change"
        step_4_verify:
          - Run tests again to confirm fix
          - Check if other tests affected by same change
          - Verify no regressions introduced
      test_maintenance:
        consistency:
          - Tests should stay consistent with current contracts
          - Update tests when contracts change, not when implementations change
          - Keep test expectations in sync with documented behavior
        documentation:
          - Test names should describe what contract they check
          - Assertions should be clear about what they expect and why
          - Comments should explain non-obvious contract requirements
      communication_with_user:
        when_fixing_code:
          - "Test failed because [contract]. Fixed code to honor contract."
        when_updating_test:
          - "Test failed because we intentionally changed [contract]."
          - "Updated test to reflect new behavior: [what changed]."
          - "This is a breaking change to [X]."
        when_unsure:
          - "Test is failing. It expects [X] but code produces [Y]."
          - "Should I: (a) fix code to return [X], or (b) update test to expect [Y]?"
          - "This depends on whether we want to change [contract]."
  linting_policy:
    principle: All code and documentation should be lint-checked and lint-clean
    scope:
      - Code files (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc.)
      - Documentation (Markdown, YAML, JSON)
      - Configuration files
      - Any generated output (if applicable)
    workflow:
      during_creation:
        - Run linters during file creation/editing when reasonable
        - Fix linting issues immediately for small changes
        - For batch operations, defer linting until batch completion
      batching_strategy:
        - Consider active todos and planned work
        - Complete related changes as a batch
        - Run linters once for entire batch
        - Fix all linting issues before committing
      performance_considerations:
        - Skip immediate linting if it adds order of magnitude to operation time
        - Skip immediate linting if substantive time cost vs value
        - Always run linting before final commit
      transparency:
        - If linting is skipped during work, explicitly tell user
        - Explain why linting was deferred
        - Confirm linting will happen before commit
        - "Example: \"Deferring linting until batch complete to avoid repeated
          overhead\""
    integration:
      - Linting runs automatically in test suite (lint:all)
      - Use project-specific lint scripts when available
      - Respect project linting configuration (.eslintrc, .markdownlint, etc.)
    priority: Standard operating procedure - linting is not optional
  documentation:
    criticality: "CRITICAL - Documentation updates are REQUIRED, not optional"
    readme_as_arbiter:
      principle: "README.md at project root is the arbiter of truth project-wide"
      requirements:
        - "README MUST be reviewed and updated for every new or potentially breaking development"
        - "New documentation files MUST be referenced/linked from README"
        - "When updating docs, ALWAYS check docs referenced in README for consistency"
        - "README is the entry point - if it's not in README, users won't find it"
        - "Breaking changes MUST be reflected in README immediately"
      workflow:
        - "New feature? Add to README features list and link to detailed docs"
        - "New docs file? Add link in README's documentation section"
        - "Changed behavior? Update README overview and examples"
        - "Deprecated feature? Update/remove from README"
        - "If README mentions it, keep it accurate or remove the mention"
      anti_patterns:
        - "DON'T create docs/*.md without adding README reference"
        - "DON'T update feature docs without checking README accuracy"
        - "DON'T ship breaking changes without README update"
        - "DON'T leave stale/outdated content in README"
    mandatory_updates:
      - "MUST update README for any user-facing feature changes"
      - "MUST update inline documentation for code changes"
      - "MUST update API docs for interface changes"
      - "MUST update docs/ directory files for affected features"
      - "MUST document breaking changes prominently"
      - "Committing without doc updates is a CRITICAL violation"
    documentation_structure:
      - "README.md: Project entry point, arbiter of truth, links to all other docs"
      - "docs/*.md: Detailed feature documentation (must be referenced from README)"
      - "Inline comments: Implementation details and rationale"
      - "API docs: Generated from inline documentation"
      - "Examples: Working code samples in examples/ directory"
    thorough_doc_review:
      - "CRITICAL: Search for ALL references to changed features"
      - "Use grep/search to find mentions in all .md files"
      - "Check README.md, docs/*.md, examples/*.md"
      - "Update ALL found references, not just obvious ones"
      - "Look for outdated examples, old terminology, changed behavior"
    maintenance:
      - Always look for and update docs after implementing new features
      - Update docs when changing existing feature behavior
      - Check README, docs directory, inline comments, and examples
      - Document breaking changes prominently
      - Search for feature mentions across entire docs/ directory
    priority:
      - User-facing changes get top priority
      - Internal/architectural changes need inline comments
      - Migration guides for breaking changes
    when_to_update:
      - New features - update README, add examples, add docs/*.md entry
      - Changed behavior - grep for feature name, update all mentions
      - New CLI flags/options - update command documentation
      - Configuration changes - update config documentation
      - Bug fixes - update relevant docs if behavior changed
      - Refactoring - check if public interfaces changed, update docs
    examples:
      - "Removed configurator field? Search 'configurator' in docs/"
      - "Changed command behavior? Grep command name in all .md files"
      - "New .claude-sync format? Update AUTO_SYNC_REPOS.md examples"
      - "Changed sync-repos purpose? Update description in README + docs/"
  markdown_formatting:
    principle: Follow markdown linting standards to avoid repetitive cleanup
    critical_spacing_rules:
      headings:
        - "MUST have blank line before AND after headings"
        - "Exception: First heading in file (no blank line before)"
        - "Example: text\\n\\n## Heading\\n\\nmore text"
      lists:
        - "MUST have blank line before AND after lists"
        - "Example: text\\n\\n- item\\n- item\\n\\nmore text"
      fenced_code_blocks:

        - "MUST have blank line after closing fence (```)"
        - "Example: text\\n\\n```\\ncode\\n```\\n\\nmore text"
      block_transitions:
        - "Always add blank line when switching between block types (text→list, text→code, heading→list, etc.)"
        - "Think: visual breathing room between different syntactic structures"
    common_violations:
      - "Heading immediately followed by list (need blank line between)"
      - "Text immediately followed by code block (need blank line before ```)"
      - "List immediately followed by text (need blank line after list)"
    linting_tools:
      - "markdownlint: npm run lint:md"
      - "Fix most issues automatically: npm run lint:md:fix (if available)"
      - "Check before committing to avoid cleanup commits"
    when_to_apply:
      - "When writing new .md files"
      - "When editing existing .md documentation"
      - "When generating markdown output (transformers, exports)"
      - "Before committing changes to any markdown file"
  file_operations:
    opening_files:
      - Use platform-appropriate commands to open files in default/configured
        editor
      - 'Windows: Use `explorer "file:///<absolute-path>"` with forward-slash
        separated absolute path'
      - "Windows: Explorer returns exit code 1 (this is normal, NOT an error for
        explorer)"
      - "Windows: Convert backslashes to forward slashes in path for file:// URL
        format"
      - 'Windows example: `explorer "file:///C:/Users/username/file.txt"`'
      - 'macOS: Use `open "<filepath>"`'
      - 'Linux: Use `xdg-open "<filepath>"` or `${EDITOR:-vi} "<filepath>"`'
      - 'VSCode-specific: Use `code "<filepath>"` when VSCode is the target
        editor'
      - Always use absolute paths, properly escaped for the URL/command format
      - Check EDITOR environment variable first if user has explicit editor

      common_issues:
        interpreter_not_found:
          symptom: VS Code can't find Python interpreter
          solutions:
            - "Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P): Python: Select Interpreter"
            - Reload VS Code window after Python installation
            - Check PATH includes Python installation directory
        import_not_resolved:
          symptom: "\"Import could not be resolved\" error"
          cause: Package not installed in selected environment
          solutions:
            - Verify correct interpreter selected
            - Install package in active environment (pip install <package>)
            - Check virtual environment is activated
        extension_activation_failed:
          symptom: Python extension won't activate
          solutions:
            - Uninstall Python and Pylance extensions
            - "Delete: %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\\ms-python.python*
              (Windows)"
            - "Delete: ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.python* (Mac/Linux)"
            - Reinstall official Microsoft Python extension
            - Remove any unverified Python extensions
        environment_detection:
          symptom: VS Code not detecting virtual environments
          solutions:
            - Use "Python: Create Environment" command
            - Ensure .venv or venv folder exists in workspace
            - Reload VS Code window
            - "Check python.defaultInterpreterPath setting"
      troubleshooting_tools:

          Environments extension if issues"
        - File issues at github.com/microsoft/vscode-python
    best_practices:
      - Use virtual environments for projects (python -m venv .venv)
      - Keep base Python installation clean
      - Stick to one installation method per system
      - Update Python and packages regularly
      - Use .python-version files for version pinning
    automation_policy:
      level: Maximum automation - do not just suggest, actually perform installation
      url_policy:
        - CRITICAL: Never hardcode download URLs in commands
        - Always check official websites for current download links
        - Use web search to find latest stable versions
        - Verify URLs are from official/reputable sources
        - Package managers (winget/brew/apt) handle versions automatically
      context_awareness:
        - CRITICAL: Check conversation context to determine VM vs user space
        - Review Mcp And Environment Selection section for pronoun guidance
        - "User says 'my machine' or 'I need' → User's machine (MCP tools)"
        - "User says 'you need' or 'can you' → VM space (bash_tool)"
        - When uncertain, ask which environment needs the tool
      execution:
        - Use silent/unattended install flags when available
        - Download installers from official sources (curl/wget)
        - Monitor installation progress and output
        - Verify successful installation (check version, run --version)
        - Report clear success or failure with specifics
      python_automation:
        before_download:
          - REQUIRED: Check python.org website for current download URLs
          - Search for latest stable Python version
          - Get official download link for target OS and architecture
          - Never use hardcoded URLs - always fetch fresh from web
        windows_vm:
          - Search python.org downloads for latest Windows 64-bit installer
          - "curl -o python-installer.exe [CURRENT_URL_FROM_WEB]"
          - "./python-installer.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1"
          - Monitor exit code and verify with python --version
        windows_user:
          - Use MCP tools to check if winget available
          - "Execute: winget install Python.Python.3 --silent (gets latest)"
          - Or guide user to Microsoft Store with specific steps
        linux_vm:
          - "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv"
          - Or appropriate package manager for distro

        macos_vm:
          - "brew install python3 (if Homebrew available, gets latest)"
          - Or check python.org for macOS installer URL and download
      monitoring:
        - Watch for error messages during installation
        - Check exit codes (0 = success)
        - Verify tool is in PATH after installation
        - Test basic functionality (run --version, simple command)
        - Report any warnings or non-critical issues
      failure_handling:
        - Capture full error output
        - Explain what went wrong in user-friendly terms
        - Suggest alternative installation methods
        - Offer manual installation guidance as fallback
  dependency_management:
    policy: All project dependencies must be secure and current
    version_requirements:
      critical: MUST NOT have known security vulnerabilities
      preferred: SHOULD use latest stable version
      compatibility: Use latest compatible version if latest has breaking changes
    before_adding_dependency:
      - Check npm/PyPI/package registry for latest version
      - Search web for known security issues with package
      - Check package reputation and maintenance status
      - Verify package is actively maintained (recent commits/releases)
      - Review package download stats and community usage
      - Check for official documentation and support
    security_checks:
      required:
        - Run npm audit (Node.js) or safety check (Python) before and after
        - MUST resolve all critical and high severity vulnerabilities
        - Document any medium/low vulnerabilities that can't be resolved
      automation:
        - Run security audit automatically when adding dependencies
        - Check for updates with npm outdated or pip list --outdated
        - Use npm audit fix or equivalent to auto-fix vulnerabilities
        - Report security issues to user with severity levels
    version_selection:
      latest_stable:
        - Use latest stable version as default
        - Check package registry for version number
        - Verify version is not pre-release (no alpha/beta/rc tags)
      compatibility_constraints:
        - Check package.json/requirements.txt for existing constraints
        - Test compatibility with existing dependencies
        - Use semver ranges appropriately (^, ~, or exact)
        - Document reason if not using latest version
      update_strategy:
        - Prefer caret ranges (^) for automatic patch/minor updates
        - Use tilde ranges (~) for patch-only updates
        - Use exact versions only when necessary for stability
        - Keep dependencies up to date with regular updates

  information_gathering:
    web_searches:
      when_to_use:
        - Uncertain about current best practices or recent changes
        - Need authoritative documentation for specific tools/versions
        - Troubleshooting issues that may have known solutions
        - Verifying recommendations before suggesting to user
        - Researching platform-specific gotchas or edge cases
      do_not_ask_permission:
        - Appropriate to search when uncertain - just do it
        - User should not need to prompt for web lookups
        - Proactively verify information accuracy
        - Better to search than provide outdated guidance
      search_strategy:
        - Include year (2025) for current best practices
        - Prioritize official documentation sources
        - Look for multiple corroborating sources
        - Check for recent updates or changes
        - Note conflicting information and explain tradeoffs
      transparency:
        - Mention when information comes from web search
        - Cite sources when providing technical guidance
        - Note when practices have changed recently
        - Flag if information conflicts with previous knowledge
  agent_collaboration:
    github_actions_workflow:
      - Repository uses claude-actions-setup for GitHub Actions integration
      - Claude Code agents are triggered by @claude mentions in issues and PR
        comments
      - "@claude mentions must appear outside of code blocks to be actionable"
      - 'Alternative trigger: Apply "claude-task" label to issues'
      - Agents have write permissions for issues, PRs, and repository contents
    mention_patterns:
      - Use `@claude` followed by specific task description
      - 'Example: "@claude implement this feature based on the issue
        description"'
      - 'Example: "@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component"'
      - 'Example: "@claude review this PR and suggest improvements"'
      - Be specific - vague mentions may result in clarifying questions
    workflow_expectations:
      - When agent completes work on an issue, expect a PR to be created
        automatically
      - PRs created by agents follow project standards defined in
        .github/CLAUDE.md
      - Agent will respect existing code patterns, test frameworks, and linting
        rules
      - If agent needs clarification, it will comment on the issue asking
        questions
      - PRs may include multiple commits showing incremental progress
    coordination_patterns:
      - Use git/GitHub as communication medium between agent instances
      - Commit + push triggers can start remote agent workflows
      - Status checks and artifact sharing via GitHub Actions
      - Issues and PRs serve as async communication channels
      - claude-task label enables batch processing of issues
    bot_behavior:
      - Agent comments come from github-actions[bot] user
      - Workflow prevents infinite loops by ignoring bot-to-bot mentions
      - Agent maintains conversation context within issue/PR threads
      - Can handle multiple @claude mentions in discussion threads
    repository_configuration:
      - .github/CLAUDE.md defines project-specific guidelines for agents
      - .github/workflows/claude.yml contains the automation workflow
      - "Optional: .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml for PR review
        automation"
      - Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret in repo
        settings
    terminology:
      - User commonly refers to remote Claude Code instances as "agent" or "the
        agent"
      - 'Context: "@claude"-triggered GitHub Actions workflows running
        autonomously'
      - 'Example: "the agent created a PR" (referring to Claude Code GitHub
        Action)'
      - 'Example: "check what the agent said" (referring to bot comments)'
      - 'Example: "tag the agent on that issue" (meaning: add @claude mention)'
      - This is colloquial usage - technically these are Claude Code processes
        in GitHub Actions
      - Understand "agent" contextually when user is discussing GitHub
        automation workflows
  git_authentication:
    environment_pattern:
      - This environment provides github-credential-vault MCP for GitHub auth
      - Use this instead of manual token/credential configuration
      - "Pattern: list_profiles() → authenticate_github({profile}) → git operations"
      - The credential vault is already configured and maintained
    why_explicit:
      - Git auth is high-stakes (failed pushes block work)
      - Manual approaches (credential.helper, embedded tokens) are anti-patterns here
      - Explicit guidance prevents frustrating trial-and-error cycles
      - This documents environmental conventions, not tool mechanics
    common_mistakes:
      - Attempting manual git config (credential vault handles this)
      - Using git remote set-url with tokens (security/maintenance issue)
      - Multiple failed attempts before checking available tools
      - Not authenticating before push attempts
    troubleshooting:
      - "Error 'could not read Username': Authenticate first (list_profiles → authenticate_github)"
      - "Error '404 Not Found': Verify repository URL (git remote -v)"
      - "Error 'Authentication failed': Token expired, notify user"
  code_quality:
    - Prioritize maintainability and clarity
    - Identify technical debt - discuss address now vs document
    - Test coverage matters, but pragmatically
  problem_solving:
    - Understand problem thoroughly before proposing solutions
    - Present multiple approaches with trade-offs
    - Be honest about limitations, risks, unknowns

    - "    → 'config' typically user-specific, default to User's Machine"
  best_practices:
    escaping_and_quoting:
      - Be thorough and careful about escaping ANYTHING that needs escaping
      - "Examples: command line arguments, regexp patterns, search/replace
        strings"
      - Always verify escaped strings are correct BEFORE using them
      - Pay particular attention to sed operations - these frequently go wrong
      - Quote file paths with spaces appropriately for the shell
      - Escape special characters in regex patterns and string replacements
      - Test escaping logic before execution, especially in multi-layer contexts
        (shell + regex, etc.)
    cross_platform_compatibility:
      - Never make assumptions about operating environment
      - Always account for Windows, macOS, and popular Unix/Linux flavors
      - "File paths: Use forward slashes where possible, handle backslashes on
        Windows"
      - "Path separators: Use path.join() or equivalent, not string
        concatenation"
      - "Line endings: Handle both CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix/Mac)"
      - "Case sensitivity: Assume filesystems may be case-sensitive or
        case-insensitive"
      - "Shell commands: Check which shell is available (bash vs cmd vs
        powershell)"
      - "Environment variables: Handle different syntax (%VAR% vs $VAR)"
      - "Executables: Consider .exe extensions on Windows, check PATH
        differently"
    markdown_quality:
      - Proactively maintain proper markdown syntax in AI-generated markdown
        content
      - Follow markdownlint standards for generated documentation and markdown
        files
      - When implementing or updating code that generates markdown, ensure lint
        compliance
      - Check generated markdown against project linting rules before committing
      - "Common issues to avoid: missing blank lines around headings/lists,
        inconsistent list markers"
      - Use markdown linting tools to validate output during development
    file_operations:
      - AVOID using sed command for text file operations - it repeatedly fails
      - "Prefer using dedicated file tools: Edit, Write, Read (in Claude Code)"
      - "For Node.js environments: Use fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync with string
        manipulation"
      - "For Python: Use file read/write with string operations"
      - "sed fails due to: escaping issues, platform differences, regex
        complexity"
      - Only use sed for trivial single-line replacements if absolutely necessary
  git_github_security:
    token_handling:
      - NEVER provide GitHub tokens via inline commands or command-line arguments
      - Do NOT proceed with authenticated GitHub operations without explicit
        consent
      - Check available MCP tooling in current chat context for secure token
        access
      - Indicate to user when there is no path to executing authenticated
        operations
      - "For VM-based git/gh operations: Use environment variables or credential
        helpers"
      - "Recommended: Set tokens in VM filesystem via GitHub CLI auth or git
        credential store"
      - "Example: gh auth login (interactive) or set GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN
        environment variable"
      - "Example: git config --global credential.helper store (caches
        credentials securely)"
      - Never echo or display token values in logs or command output
    vm_token_setup:
      - "Preferred method: Use gh CLI auth (gh auth login) for interactive token
        setup"
      - "Alternative: Export GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN as environment variable in
        VM"
      - "For git operations: Configure credential helper (git credential-cache
        or credential-store)"
      - "Token files: Store in ~/.config/gh/ or use git credential helper, never
        in code"
      - "Verify token access before operations: gh auth status"
      - "Token scope requirements: Ensure token has necessary permissions for
        planned operations"
  git_github_workflow:
    - "CRITICAL: Prefer bash commands (git, gh) over tool abstractions"
    - Clone repos locally to work efficiently
    - Use gh CLI for GitHub operations
    - ALWAYS verify username (nlsherman-24861) before repo operations
    - NEVER assume repo ownership - confirm first
  git_commit_discipline:
    principle: Reverts and destructive operations require clear reasoning and communication
    philosophy:
      - Git history is documentation - don't erase without understanding
      - Reverting working code is dangerous - might break contracts/expectations
      - "Default stance: investigate WHY before reverting/destroying"
    when_reverting_commits:
      anti_pattern:
        - "DON'T: git revert without understanding what the commit did"
        - "DON'T: Revert because 'something feels off' without investigation"
        - "DON'T: Silent reverts with empty messages ('Revert xyz')"
      required_before_revert:
        - Read the commit being reverted (full diff, message, context)
        - Understand what it was trying to accomplish
        - Identify specific problem with the change
        - Check if tests still pass after revert
        - Verify revert doesn't break contracts/APIs/expected behavior
      valid_reasons_to_revert:
        - Commit introduces failing tests/builds
        - Commit breaks documented behavior or contracts
        - Commit introduces security issue
        - Clear conflict with user requirements
      revert_commit_message_must_include:
        - What commit is being reverted and why
        - What problem the revert solves
        - What alternative approach will be taken (if any)
        - "Example: 'Revert perspective clarification (commit abc123) because it conflicts with hybrid model approach in commit def456. Will implement directive framing instead.'"
    communication_requirements:
      before_destructive_operations:
        - "Explain: 'I found this commit that does X. I want to revert it because Y. This means we'll lose Z. Is that okay?'"
        - Wait for user confirmation before reverting
        - If unclear, investigate further rather than guess
      after_revert:
        - Document in commit message what was lost
        - Note if this creates technical debt or incomplete features
        - Track follow-up work needed to restore functionality properly
    workflow_when_encountering_problematic_commit:
      step_1_investigate:
        - "git show <commit-hash> # Read full diff"
        - "git log <commit-hash> # Read commit message"
        - Understand the intent and implementation
      step_2_analyze:
        - Does current code still include this change?
        - Are there tests that depend on it?
        - Are there downstream commits that build on it?

          when: Intent was good, implementation needs refinement
          action: Fix forward, don't revert
        option_b_revert_with_reasoning:
          when: Change is fundamentally wrong direction
          action: Revert with detailed explanation

  configurator_setup:
    description: claude-actions-setup tool for repository automation
    when_to_suggest:
      - Infer desire to configure new projects/repositories
      - Assume configurator should be run when creating new projects (if tooling
        available)
      - Check current environment has necessary tools (git, gh CLI, Node.js)
      - Offer to run configurator when ad-hoc discussions result in significant
        structured code
      - Suggest setup when code emerges without conventions/scaffolding that
        configurator provides
      - "Example triggers: \"Let's start a new project\", \"Created a new repo\",
        writing multiple files ad-hoc"
    benefits:
      - Automated .github/CLAUDE.md creation with auto-detected tech stack
      - GitHub Actions workflows for @claude automation
      - CI/CD template setup based on detected build tools
      - Consistent project structure across repositories
      - Immediate agent collaboration capability via @claude mentions
  preference_sync:
    description: claude-context-sync tool for preference management
    scope: ONLY syncs CLAUDE.md preference files - NOT coupled to configurators
    separation_of_concerns:
      - claude-context-sync syncs CLAUDE.md preferences across repos
      - claude-actions-setup handles GitHub Actions/CI/CD (separate tool)
      - ".claude-sync marker only indicates 'sync preferences here'"
      - No configurator field in .claude-sync (removed to decouple)
    bulk_marking:
      - "Use `mark --bulk --user <username>` to clone and mark all private repos"
      - "Exclude repos with `--exclude pattern1 pattern2` (supports globs:
        test-*, *-backup)"
      - Create ~/.repos/.claude-sync-workspace for persistent excludes
    discovery:
      - "GitHub API mode: `discover --source github --user <username>` (no
        cloning)"
      - "Filesystem mode: `discover --source filesystem` (default, scans local
        dirs)"
      - "Discovered repos with auto_update: true sync automatically via `sync-repos
        --auto`"
    sync_commands:
      - "`sync --target all` syncs global CLAUDE.md only"
      - "`sync --target global` syncs only ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
      - "`sync-repos` syncs CLAUDE.md files to all marked repositories"
      - "`sync-repos --auto` only syncs repos with auto_update: true"
      - "Per-repo status shown: ✓ success, ⚠ skipped, ✗ failed"
      - "Use `--dry-run` flag to preview changes before applying"
    yaml_linting:
      - "Run `npm run lint:yaml` to check YAML formatting"
      - "Run `npm run lint:yaml:fix` to auto-fix YAML issues (if available)"
      - Linting runs automatically in test suite
      - "Never use `- \"\"` for blank lines - just omit the line"
  timeboxing_and_completion:
    philosophy:
      - Balance between "good enough" and "perfect now" - lean toward "perfect
        now because we might as well"
      - NEVER arbitrarily ignore issues just to be done ("I've had enough, I
        quit")
      - NEVER solve problems by "not caring" - address root causes
      - If something is worth doing, do it right - shortcuts often create more
        work later
      - Timeboxing is for exploration/research, not for cutting corners on known
        issues
    when_to_timebox:
      - "Exploratory work: \"Let's try this approach for 30 minutes\""
      - 'Research/investigation: "Spend an hour understanding this library"'
      - 'Experiments: "Quick proof-of-concept to validate approach"'
    when_not_to_timebox:
      - Fixing known bugs - fix them properly
      - Addressing test failures - make tests pass
      - Resolving linting errors - clean code is non-negotiable
      - Security issues - never postpone or ignore

# CRITICAL META-PATTERN: Avoid "Implementation as Specification"

# These principles apply to ALL projects, not just claude-context-sync.
# They represent hard-won lessons about building truly generic systems.

coding_and_design_principles:
  avoid_specific_as_generic:
    name: "Implementation-as-Specification Fallacy"
    description: "When code that works for YOUR specific case gets mistaken for a general solution"

    problem_pattern:
      symptom: "Function/class promises to handle entire domain, but only handles your instance"
      examples:
        - "displayProduct() only works for physical goods (not digital/subscriptions)"
        - "sendNotification() only sends email (not SMS/push/in-app)"
        - "formatUserProfile() assumes everyone is an engineer"
        - "exportData() only outputs JSON (not XML/CSV/protobuf)"
      false_confidence: "Tests pass because they only use your actual data"

    red_flags:
      - "Hardcoded strings referencing YOUR specifics (product weight, email addresses, job titles)"
      - "Hardcoded key access (data.physical when schema allows digital/subscription)"
      - "Tests only use your business data (books, not ebooks/subscriptions)"
      - "Function names promise generality (handleAllProducts) but body is specific"
      - "Documentation shows one example (yours), not multiple domain examples"
      - "Fallback defaults encode your specifics (defaulting to email when SMS is valid)"

    green_patterns:
      - "Generic iteration: for (const [type, data] of Object.entries(items))"
      - "Configuration-driven: Define schemas for each variant up front"
      - "Tests with DIFFERENT variants (if you sell books, test ebooks/subscriptions)"
      - "Documentation shows 3-5 examples from across the domain"
      - "No baked-in assumptions about what variant user will have"
      - "Data structure designed to represent ALL variants, not just yours"

    before_coding_checklist:
      - "DOMAIN: What's the full domain? (All product types, not just books)"
      - "VARIANCE: Name 3-5 DIFFERENT examples (books, ebooks, subscriptions, gift cards)"
      - "UNIQUE NEEDS: What's different about each? (Books have weight, ebooks have fileSize)"
      - "SCHEMA: Can your data structure represent ALL variants?"

    while_coding_checklist:
      - "IMPLEMENTATION: Works identically well for ALL examples without modification?"
      - "NO HARDCODING: Avoided hardcoded fields that only exist in your variant?"
      - "ITERATION: Using loops/maps instead of if(mySpecificType)?"
      - "LET DATA SPEAK: Data structure drives behavior, not hardcoded logic?"

    testing_checklist:
      - "Test your actual data (books) - minimum viable"
      - "Test DIFFERENT valid data (ebooks) - catch hardcoded assumptions"
      - "Test VERY DIFFERENT data (subscriptions) - verify true generality"
      - "Test multiple simultaneous (books AND ebooks) - handle combinations"
      - "Negative assertions: ebook test should NOT contain shipping/weight"

    counter_example_testing:
      principle: "Test with valid data that's DIFFERENT from your use case"
      why: "Catches baked-in assumptions that slip through when tests use your data"
      real_world_examples:
        - "E-commerce: If you sell books, test with ebooks/subscriptions/gift cards"
        - "Auth: If you use email login, test with SMS/OAuth/authenticator apps"
        - "Users: If you're an engineer, test with teacher/artist/scientist profiles"
        - "Formats: If you output JSON, test XML/CSV/Protocol Buffers"
        - "Notifications: If you send email, test SMS/push/in-app/webhook"
      test_structure:
        bad: "test('handles products', () => testWith(myBookData))"
        good: "test('handles ebooks without shipping', () => { result = testWith(ebookData); expect(!result.includes('shipping')) })"

  data_shaping_over_logic:
    principle: "Shape data to be transformation-ready, not logic-heavy"
    description: "Data structures should be designed so transformations are simple iterations/mappings"

    examples:
      good:
        - "creative_pursuits: { [pursuitType]: { alias, active_work } } → iterate over types"
        - "philosophy: ['Statement 1', 'Statement 2'] → join with '. '"
        - "Pronounless values in YAML → transformers add perspective based on section"
      bad:
        - "Hardcoding profession in transformer instead of letting data speak"
        - "Special case logic for 'music' vs 'writing' instead of generic pursuit handling"
        - "Embedding pronouns in YAML forcing specific narrative voice"

    transformation_patterns:
      iterate_dont_enumerate: "for...of Object.entries() not if (data.music) {...} if (data.writing)"
      templates_not_strings: "Use templates/patterns where possible, avoid 'The user makes music under'"
      data_drives_output: "Let data structure determine output shape, not hardcoded logic"

  schema_as_specification:
    principle: "Schema is the contract - document ALL allowed variance"
    requirements:
      - "Every section mentioned must be fully documented with structure"
      - "Use descriptions to clarify intent and allowed values"
      - "Show examples from multiple domains, not just author's use case"
      - "Make additionalProperties explicit (are custom keys allowed?)"

  test_coverage_philosophy:
    beyond_happy_path:
      - "Test happy path with author's data (minimum viable)"
      - "Test counter-examples with very different valid data (catch hardcoding)"
      - "Test edge cases (empty, missing, malformed)"
      - "Test multiple simultaneous values (e.g., both music AND writing pursuits)"

    test_naming_clarity:
      good: "it('should format writing creative pursuits with pen_name')"
      bad: "it('should work')"
      why: "Specific test names document what variance is covered"
