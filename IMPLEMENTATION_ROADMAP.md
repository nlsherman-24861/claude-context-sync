# Claude Context Sync - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for `claude-context-sync`, a tool that maintains a single source of truth for Claude preferences across chat, code, and project interfaces.

## Project Status

**Repository**: https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync  
**Current Phase**: Planning Complete  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 Implementation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**Issue**: [#1](https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync/issues/1)  
**Status**: Open  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**Deliverables**:

- CLI scaffolding with Commander.js
- Configuration management (YAML)
- File system utilities
- Logging infrastructure
- Test framework setup

**Why First**: Everything else builds on this foundation.

---

### Phase 2: Format Transformers

**Issue**: [#2](https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync/issues/2)  
**Status**: Open  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Deliverables**:

- Base transformer interface
- Chat format transformer (natural prose)
- CLAUDE.md format transformer (structured markdown)
- Export command implementation
- Comprehensive transformation tests

**Why Second**: Need to transform preferences before we can sync them anywhere.

---

### Phase 3: Playwright Session Management

**Issue**: [#3](https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync/issues/3)  
**Status**: Open  
**Complexity**: Medium-High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Deliverables**:

- Headed browser session capture
- Session persistence to JSON
- Session validation logic
- Session refresh capability
- Setup and session CLI commands

**Why Third**: Enables headless browser automation for Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: Headless Browser Automation

**Issue**: [#4](https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync/issues/4)  
**Status**: Open  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Deliverables**:

- Headless preference update automation
- Flexible selector strategies
- Sync command for chat target
- Comprehensive error handling
- Dry run and verbose modes

**Why Fourth**: The "magic" - automated Claude Chat updates.

---

### Phase 5: File Sync Operations

**Issue**: [#5](https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync/issues/5)  
**Status**: Open  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Deliverables**:

- Global CLAUDE.md sync
- Project CLAUDE.md sync with merging
- Backup management
- Sync all targets command
- Content preservation logic

**Why Fifth**: Completes the full sync pipeline.

---

## Total Estimated Timeline

**Minimum**: 10 days (sequential, focused work)  
**Realistic**: 2-3 weeks (with testing, iteration, polish)

## Dependencies Graph

```
Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
    ├─→ Phase 2 (Format Transformers)
    │       └─→ Phase 5 (File Sync)
    │
    └─→ Phase 3 (Session Management)
            └─→ Phase 4 (Browser Automation)
```

**Parallel Work Opportunities**:

- After Phase 1: Can work on Phase 2 and Phase 3 simultaneously
- After Phases 2-3: Can work on Phases 4-5 simultaneously

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- [ ] Can edit `preferences.yaml`
- [ ] Can export to chat format
- [ ] Can sync to Claude Chat (headless)
- [ ] Can sync to global CLAUDE.md

### Full Feature Set

- [ ] All MVP criteria
- [ ] Can sync to project CLAUDE.md (with merge)
- [ ] Session management (capture, validate, refresh)
- [ ] Dry run mode for all operations
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Full test coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Risk Areas

### High Risk

- **Playwright Selectors**: Claude Chat UI will change, breaking selectors
  - *Mitigation*: Fallback selector strategies, clear error messages
  
- **Session Expiration**: Sessions may expire unexpectedly
  - *Mitigation*: Auto-validation before sync, clear refresh instructions

### Medium Risk

- **Content Merging**: Complex logic to preserve project content
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive tests, backup before merge
  
- **Cross-Platform**: File paths differ (Windows vs Unix)
  - *Mitigation*: Use `path.join()`, test on multiple platforms

### Low Risk

- **YAML Parsing**: Well-established library
- **File Operations**: Standard Node.js APIs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per Phase)

- Individual functions and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast, comprehensive coverage

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end workflows
- Real file operations (temp directories)
- Session capture (manual, one-time)

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Initial setup flow (auth capture)
- [ ] Dry run mode (all targets)
- [ ] Real sync (all targets)
- [ ] Error scenarios (expired session, missing files)
- [ ] Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Documentation Plan

### User Documentation

- [ ] README with quick start
- [ ] Configuration guide (YAML schema)
- [ ] Command reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration guide

### Developer Documentation

- [ ] Architecture overview
- [ ] Adding new format transformers
- [ ] Selector update guide (when UI changes)
- [ ] Testing guide

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Phase 6: Polish and UX Improvements

**Realistic Near-Term Extensions**:

- Interactive `init` wizard with prompts
- Diff preview before sync operations (show changes)
- Profile switching (work/personal/project-specific contexts)
- Improved error messages and troubleshooting guides

### Ideas Worth Exploring (Lower Priority)

**If Pain Points Emerge**:

- Session encryption (if security becomes a concern)
- Additional format support - TOML/JSON (if requested)
- GitHub Actions workflow templates (complement to claude-actions-setup)

**Ambitious But Interesting**:

- Selector auto-discovery (screenshot + vision model) - *would solve Playwright brittleness, but major undertaking*
- VS Code extension - *turns this into a separate product*
- Automatic preference inference from chat history - *cool but creepy?*

> **Note**: Ideas listed here are not commitments. They represent possible directions if specific use cases emerge. Focus remains on core sync functionality.

## Getting Started

### For Development

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/nlsherman-24861/claude-context-sync.git
cd claude-context-sync
npm install

# Start with Phase 1
# See Issue #1 for detailed requirements
```
