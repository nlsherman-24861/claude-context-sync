- Pragmatic over dogmatic

### Testing Standards

**Criticality**: CRITICAL - Tests, linting, and docs are NOT optional. They are core requirements.

**Core Requirements**:

- Tests MUST always pass for new OR changed code
- No reduced test coverage after changes
- Clean THEN build BEFORE each test run
- Ensure CI still passes in repositories (if applicable)
- NEVER commit without running full test suite
- NEVER skip failing tests without explicit user approval

**Mandatory Workflow**:

- Description: REQUIRED for every code change - not suggestions, but requirements
- Before Any Commit:
  - 1. Update/add tests for changed functionality
  - 2. Run full test suite (npm test, pytest, etc.)
  - 3. Fix ALL failing tests or get explicit user approval to skip
  - 4. Run linting (npm run lint:all or equivalent)
  - 5. Fix ALL linting errors
  - 6. Update documentation (README, inline docs, API docs)
  - 7. Verify all changes work as expected
- Violations:
  - Committing without running tests is a CRITICAL violation
  - Committing with failing tests is a CRITICAL violation
  - Committing without updating docs is a CRITICAL violation
  - If you skip any step, you MUST explicitly tell user and get approval

**Optional Workflow**:

- Run full test suite before committing
- Fix or skip (with justification) failing tests immediately
- Update tests when changing behavior
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes

**Execution Requirements**:

- Test runs MUST fully complete before reporting success - do not report success on partial/incomplete runs
- Verify test output indicates success: check for "passing", "✓", "OK", or absence of "FAIL"/"ERROR"
- Do NOT assume tests passed if command times out or is interrupted
- Be proactively lenient with test timeouts - many test suites take 2+ minutes to complete
- Set generous timeout values (120000ms minimum, 300000ms for comprehensive suites)
- If test run times out, increase timeout and retry rather than assuming failure
- Parse test output for actual results: "X tests passing", "0 failed", etc.
- Watch mode (e.g., "Waiting for file changes") indicates success IF tests passed before entering watch
- Example success indicators: "All tests passed", "PASS", exit code 0
- Example failure indicators: "FAIL", "Error", "✗", non-zero exit code, timeout before completion

**Test Contract Integrity**:

- Principle: Tests define contracts - changing tests to match output is a last resort, not default
- Philosophy:
  - Tests encode expected behavior and contracts
  - Failing tests indicate broken contracts, not broken tests
  - Default response to test failure is fix the code, not fix the test
  - Changing tests is valid ONLY when intentionally changing contracts

### Linting Policy

**Principle**: All code and documentation should be lint-checked and lint-clean

**Scope**:

- Code files (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- Documentation (Markdown, YAML, JSON)
- Configuration files
- Any generated output (if applicable)

**Workflow**:

- During Creation:
  - Run linters during file creation/editing when reasonable
  - Fix linting issues immediately for small changes
  - For batch operations, defer linting until batch completion
- Batching Strategy:
  - Consider active todos and planned work
  - Complete related changes as a batch
  - Run linters once for entire batch
  - Fix all linting issues before committing
- Performance Considerations:
  - Skip immediate linting if it adds order of magnitude to operation time
  - Skip immediate linting if substantive time cost vs value
  - Always run linting before final commit
- Transparency:
  - If linting is skipped during work, explicitly tell user
  - Explain why linting was deferred
  - Confirm linting will happen before commit
  - Example: "Deferring linting until batch complete to avoid repeated overhead"

**Integration**:

- Linting runs automatically in test suite (lint:all)
- Use project-specific lint scripts when available
- Respect project linting configuration (.eslintrc, .markdownlint, etc.)

**Priority**: Standard operating procedure - linting is not optional

### Documentation

**Criticality**: CRITICAL - Documentation updates are REQUIRED, not optional

**Readme As Arbiter**:

- Principle: README.md at project root is the arbiter of truth project-wide
- Requirements:
  - README MUST be reviewed and updated for every new or potentially breaking development
  - New documentation files MUST be referenced/linked from README
  - When updating docs, ALWAYS check docs referenced in README for consistency
  - README is the entry point - if it's not in README, users won't find it
  - Breaking changes MUST be reflected in README immediately
- Workflow:
  - New feature? Add to README features list and link to detailed docs
  - New docs file? Add link in README's documentation section
  - Changed behavior? Update README overview and examples
  - Deprecated feature? Update/remove from README
  - If README mentions it, keep it accurate or remove the mention
- Anti Patterns:
  - DON'T create docs/*.md without adding README reference
  - DON'T update feature docs without checking README accuracy
  - DON'T ship breaking changes without README update
  - DON'T leave stale/outdated content in README

**Mandatory Updates**:

- MUST update README for any user-facing feature changes
- MUST update inline documentation for code changes
- MUST update API docs for interface changes
- MUST update docs/ directory files for affected features
- MUST document breaking changes prominently
- Committing without doc updates is a CRITICAL violation

**Documentation Structure**:

- README.md: Project entry point, arbiter of truth, links to all other docs
- docs/*.md: Detailed feature documentation (must be referenced from README)
- Inline comments: Implementation details and rationale
- API docs: Generated from inline documentation
- Examples: Working code samples in examples/ directory

**Thorough Doc Review**:

- CRITICAL: Search for ALL references to changed features
- Use grep/search to find mentions in all .md files
- Check README.md, docs/*.md, examples/*.md
- Update ALL found references, not just obvious ones
- Look for outdated examples, old terminology, changed behavior

**Maintenance**:

- Always look for and update docs after implementing new features
- Update docs when changing existing feature behavior
- Check README, docs directory, inline comments, and examples
- Document breaking changes prominently
- Search for feature mentions across entire docs/ directory

**Priority**:

- User-facing changes get top priority
- Internal/architectural changes need inline comments
- Migration guides for breaking changes

**When To Update**:

- New features - update README, add examples, add docs/*.md entry
- Changed behavior - grep for feature name, update all mentions
- New CLI flags/options - update command documentation
- Configuration changes - update config documentation
- Bug fixes - update relevant docs if behavior changed
- Refactoring - check if public interfaces changed, update docs

**Examples**:

- Removed configurator field? Search 'configurator' in docs/
- Changed command behavior? Grep command name in all .md files
- New .claude-sync format? Update AUTO_SYNC_REPOS.md examples
- Changed sync-repos purpose? Update description in README + docs/

### Markdown Formatting

**Principle**: Follow markdown linting standards to avoid repetitive cleanup

**Critical Spacing Rules**:

- Headings:
  - MUST have blank line before AND after headings
  - Exception: First heading in file (no blank line before)
  - Example: text\n\n## Heading\n\nmore text
- Lists:
  - MUST have blank line before AND after lists
  - Example: text\n\n- item\n- item\n\nmore text
- Fenced Code Blocks:
  - MUST have blank line before opening fence (```)
  - MUST have blank line after closing fence (```)
  - Example: text\n\n```\ncode\n```\n\nmore text
- Block Transitions:
  - Always add blank line when switching between block types (text→list, text→code, heading→list, etc.)
  - Think: visual breathing room between different syntactic structures

**Common Violations**:

- Heading immediately followed by list (need blank line between)
- Text immediately followed by code block (need blank line before ```)
- List immediately followed by text (need blank line after list)

**Linting Tools**:

- markdownlint: npm run lint:md
- Fix most issues automatically: npm run lint:md:fix (if available)
- Check before committing to avoid cleanup commits

**When To Apply**:

- When writing new .md files
- When editing existing .md documentation
- When generating markdown output (transformers, exports)
- Before committing changes to any markdown file

### File Operations

**Opening Files**:

- Use platform-appropriate commands to open files in default/configured editor
- Windows: Use `explorer "file:///<absolute-path>"` with forward-slash separated absolute path
- Windows: Explorer returns exit code 1 (this is normal, NOT an error for explorer)
- Windows: Convert backslashes to forward slashes in path for file:// URL format
- Windows example: `explorer "file:///C:/Users/username/file.txt"`
- macOS: Use `open "<filepath>"`
- Linux: Use `xdg-open "<filepath>"` or `${EDITOR:-vi} "<filepath>"`
- VSCode-specific: Use `code "<filepath>"` when VSCode is the target editor
- Always use absolute paths, properly escaped for the URL/command format
- Check EDITOR environment variable first if user has explicit editor preference

### Python Setup

**Guidance**: Suggest and help with Python setup if not available or misconfigured

**Installation Methods**:

**Vscode Integration**:

- Extension: Install "Python" extension by Microsoft (ms-python.python)
- Troubleshooting Tools:
  - Command: "Python: Run Python Environment Tool (PET) in Terminal"
  - Setting: "python.useEnvironmentsExtension": false to disable Python Environments extension if issues
  - File issues at github.com/microsoft/vscode-python

**Best Practices**:

- Use virtual environments for projects (python -m venv .venv)
- Keep base Python installation clean
- Stick to one installation method per system
- Update Python and packages regularly
- Use .python-version files for version pinning

**Automation Policy**:

- Level: Maximum automation - do not just suggest, actually perform installation
- Url Policy:
  - [object Object]
  - Always check official websites for current download links
  - Use web search to find latest stable versions
  - Verify URLs are from official/reputable sources
  - Package managers (winget/brew/apt) handle versions automatically
- Context Awareness:
  - [object Object]
  - Review Mcp And Environment Selection section for pronoun guidance
  - User says 'my machine' or 'I need' → User's machine (MCP tools)
  - User says 'you need' or 'can you' → VM space (bash_tool)
  - When uncertain, ask which environment needs the tool
- Execution:
  - Use silent/unattended install flags when available
  - Download installers from official sources (curl/wget)
  - Monitor installation progress and output
  - Verify successful installation (check version, run --version)
  - Report clear success or failure with specifics
- Monitoring:
  - Watch for error messages during installation
  - Check exit codes (0 = success)
  - Verify tool is in PATH after installation
  - Test basic functionality (run --version, simple command)
  - Report any warnings or non-critical issues
- Failure Handling:
  - Capture full error output
  - Explain what went wrong in user-friendly terms
  - Suggest alternative installation methods
  - Offer manual installation guidance as fallback

### Dependency Management

**Policy**: All project dependencies must be secure and current

**Version Requirements**:

- Critical: MUST NOT have known security vulnerabilities
- Preferred: SHOULD use latest stable version
- Compatibility: Use latest compatible version if latest has breaking changes

**Before Adding Dependency**:

- Check npm/PyPI/package registry for latest version
- Search web for known security issues with package
- Check package reputation and maintenance status
- Verify package is actively maintained (recent commits/releases)
- Review package download stats and community usage
- Check for official documentation and support

**Security Checks**:

- Required:
  - Run npm audit (Node.js) or safety check (Python) before and after
  - MUST resolve all critical and high severity vulnerabilities
  - Document any medium/low vulnerabilities that can't be resolved
- Automation:
  - Run security audit automatically when adding dependencies
  - Check for updates with npm outdated or pip list --outdated
  - Use npm audit fix or equivalent to auto-fix vulnerabilities
  - Report security issues to user with severity levels

**Version Selection**:

- Latest Stable:
  - Use latest stable version as default
  - Check package registry for version number
  - Verify version is not pre-release (no alpha/beta/rc tags)
- Compatibility Constraints:
  - Check package.json/requirements.txt for existing constraints
  - Test compatibility with existing dependencies
  - Use semver ranges appropriately (^, ~, or exact)
  - Document reason if not using latest version
- Update Strategy:
  - Prefer caret ranges (^) for automatic patch/minor updates
  - Use tilde ranges (~) for patch-only updates
  - Use exact versions only when necessary for stability
  - Keep dependencies up to date with regular updates

**Adding Dependencies**:

- Process:
  - 1. Search web for package name + 'npm' or 'pypi'
  - 2. Check package registry page for latest version
  - 3. Search for 'package-name security vulnerabilities'
  - 4. Check GitHub repo for maintenance status
  - 5. Install with specific version: npm install package@version
  - 6. Run security audit
  - 7. Test that package works as expected
  - 8. Commit package.json/package-lock.json changes
- Documentation:
  - Document why dependency was added
  - Note any known issues or limitations
  - Reference documentation or examples used

**Updating Dependencies**:

- Regular Updates:
  - Check for updates periodically
  - Update patch versions frequently (bug fixes only)
  - Update minor versions after testing (new features)
  - Update major versions carefully (breaking changes)
- Process:
  - Run: npm outdated or pip list --outdated
  - Review changelog for breaking changes
  - Update one dependency at a time for large changes
  - Run full test suite after each update
  - Check for deprecation warnings
- Automation:
  - Offer to update dependencies when outdated
  - Run tests automatically after updates
  - Rollback if tests fail

### Nodejs Setup

**Guidance**: Suggest and help with Node.js/npm setup if not available

**Installation Methods**:

**Npm Issues**:

**Automation Policy**:

- Level: Perform installation automatically with user awareness
- Monitoring:
  - Check exit codes and output for errors
  - Verify npm is included and working
  - Test with simple npm command
  - Run npm install automatically if package.json present
- Post Install:
  - Check for package.json in project
  - Offer to run npm install if dependencies not installed
  - Verify package-lock.json is created
  - Check for vulnerabilities with npm audit

### Git Setup

**Guidance**: Suggest and help with Git setup if not available

**Installation Methods**:

**Configuration**:

- Required:
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  - git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
- Recommended:
  - git config --global init.defaultBranch main
  - git config --global core.autocrlf (true on Windows, input on Mac/Linux)

**Authentication**:

- Prefer: GitHub CLI (gh) for authentication
- Ssh: Offer to help set up SSH keys if needed
- Https: Use credential manager (Git Credential Manager included with Git for Windows)

**Automation Policy**:

- Level: Perform installation and configuration automatically
- Configuration Automation:
  - Check git config user.name and user.email
  - If not set, ask user for details and configure automatically
  - git config --global user.name "Name"
  - git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
  - git config --global init.defaultBranch main
  - Set core.autocrlf based on OS
- Github Cli Automation:
  - Check if gh is installed when working with GitHub repos
  - Install automatically: winget install GitHub.cli --silent (Windows)
  - brew install gh (macOS)
  - sudo apt install gh (Linux)
  - Offer to authenticate with gh auth login
- Monitoring:
  - Verify git works after installation
  - Check git config is properly set
  - Test git commands work
  - Verify credential helper is configured

### Information Gathering

**Web Searches**:

- When To Use:
  - Uncertain about current best practices or recent changes
  - Need authoritative documentation for specific tools/versions
  - Troubleshooting issues that may have known solutions
  - Verifying recommendations before suggesting to user
  - Researching platform-specific gotchas or edge cases
- Do Not Ask Permission:
  - Appropriate to search when uncertain - just do it
  - User should not need to prompt for web lookups
  - Proactively verify information accuracy
  - Better to search than provide outdated guidance
- Search Strategy:
  - Include year (2025) for current best practices
  - Prioritize official documentation sources
  - Look for multiple corroborating sources
  - Check for recent updates or changes
  - Note conflicting information and explain tradeoffs
- Transparency:
  - Mention when information comes from web search
  - Cite sources when providing technical guidance
  - Note when practices have changed recently
  - Flag if information conflicts with previous knowledge

### Agent Collaboration

**Github Actions Workflow**:

- Repository uses claude-actions-setup for GitHub Actions integration
- Claude Code agents are triggered by @claude mentions in issues and PR comments
- @claude mentions must appear outside of code blocks to be actionable
- Alternative trigger: Apply "claude-task" label to issues
- Agents have write permissions for issues, PRs, and repository contents

**Mention Patterns**:

- Use `@claude` followed by specific task description
- Example: "@claude implement this feature based on the issue description"
- Example: "@claude fix the TypeError in the user dashboard component"
- Example: "@claude review this PR and suggest improvements"
- Be specific - vague mentions may result in clarifying questions

**Workflow Expectations**:

- When agent completes work on an issue, expect a PR to be created automatically
- PRs created by agents follow project standards defined in .github/CLAUDE.md
- Agent will respect existing code patterns, test frameworks, and linting rules
- If agent needs clarification, it will comment on the issue asking questions
- PRs may include multiple commits showing incremental progress

**Coordination Patterns**:

- Use git/GitHub as communication medium between agent instances
- Commit + push triggers can start remote agent workflows
- Status checks and artifact sharing via GitHub Actions
- Issues and PRs serve as async communication channels
- claude-task label enables batch processing of issues

**Bot Behavior**:

- Agent comments come from github-actions[bot] user
- Workflow prevents infinite loops by ignoring bot-to-bot mentions
- Agent maintains conversation context within issue/PR threads
- Can handle multiple @claude mentions in discussion threads

**Repository Configuration**:

- .github/CLAUDE.md defines project-specific guidelines for agents
- .github/workflows/claude.yml contains the automation workflow
- Optional: .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml for PR review automation
- Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret in repo settings

**Terminology**:

- User commonly refers to remote Claude Code instances as "agent" or "the agent"
- Context: "@claude"-triggered GitHub Actions workflows running autonomously
- Example: "the agent created a PR" (referring to Claude Code GitHub Action)
- Example: "check what the agent said" (referring to bot comments)
- Example: "tag the agent on that issue" (meaning: add @claude mention)
- This is colloquial usage - technically these are Claude Code processes in GitHub Actions
- Understand "agent" contextually when user is discussing GitHub automation workflows

### Git Authentication

**Environment Pattern**:

- This environment provides github-credential-vault MCP for GitHub auth
- Use this instead of manual token/credential configuration
- Pattern: list_profiles() → authenticate_github({profile}) → git operations
- The credential vault is already configured and maintained

**Why Explicit**:

- Git auth is high-stakes (failed pushes block work)
- Manual approaches (credential.helper, embedded tokens) are anti-patterns here
- Explicit guidance prevents frustrating trial-and-error cycles
- This documents environmental conventions, not tool mechanics

**Common Mistakes**:

- Attempting manual git config (credential vault handles this)
- Using git remote set-url with tokens (security/maintenance issue)
- Multiple failed attempts before checking available tools
- Not authenticating before push attempts

**Troubleshooting**:

- Error 'could not read Username': Authenticate first (list_profiles → authenticate_github)
- Error '404 Not Found': Verify repository URL (git remote -v)
- Error 'Authentication failed': Token expired, notify user

### Code Quality

- Prioritize maintainability and clarity
- Identify technical debt - discuss address now vs document
- Test coverage matters, but pragmatically

### Problem Solving

- Understand problem thoroughly before proposing solutions
- Present multiple approaches with trade-offs
- Be honest about limitations, risks, unknowns

### Mcp And Environment Selection

- CRITICAL - Context Disambiguation via Pronouns:
  - Two distinct environments exist with different tooling:
  - USER'S PERSPECTIVE:
    - 'you/your' → VM space (Claude's isolated Linux container)
      - Example: 'Can you clone this repo and run tests?'
      - Tools: bash_tool, str_replace, view, create_file
      - Use for: Cloning repos, building, testing, analyzing code
    - 'I/me/my' → User's machine (Windows workstation)
      - Example: 'Check my Claude Code settings'
      - Tools: Filesystem MCP, CLI MCP, Windows MCP, browser-use
      - Use for: Checking configs, accessing user files, browser automation
  - AGENT'S PERSPECTIVE:
    - 'you/your' → User's machine
      - Example: 'Your config is at C:\Users\n\.claude'
    - 'I/me/my' → VM space
      - Example: 'I cloned it to /home/claude/project'
  - ENVIRONMENT DECISION TREE:
    - 1. Check for possessive pronouns:
      - - 'my/mine' from user → User's Machine (MCP)
      - - 'your/yours' from user → VM Space (bash_tool)
    - 2. If no clear pronoun, infer from request type:
      - - Config/settings files → User's Machine
      - - 'Clone and work on...' → VM Space
      - - Browser operations → User's Machine
      - - Build/test/analyze → VM Space (after clone)
      - - Windows-specific paths → User's Machine
  - TOOL SELECTION HEURISTICS:
  - For User's Machine (MCP):
    - 1. Filesystem MCP - First choice for config files
      - - Check known paths: %USERPROFILE%\.claude, %APPDATA%, %LOCALAPPDATA%
      - - Direct access, no shell syntax issues
    - 2. CLI MCP - For running executables or simple commands
      - - Use simple commands: cd, dir, where
      - - Avoid complex flags/escaping (causes security violations)
    - 3. Windows MCP - Desktop automation, UI interaction
    - 4. Browser-use - Web automation
    - 5. GitHub-credential-vault - Credential management
  - For VM Space (bash_tool):
    - 1. bash_tool - Primary workhorse
      - - Git operations (clone, commit, push)
      - - Building, testing, analyzing
      - - File manipulation in /home/claude
    - 2. str_replace - Targeted file edits
    - 3. view - Reading files/directories
    - 4. create_file - New file creation
  - CONFIG FILE ACCESS PATTERN:
    - 1. Check known locations with Filesystem MCP first
    - 2. If not found: CLI MCP with simple commands (cd, dir)
    - 3. Last resort: Complex search (risk of syntax errors)
  - PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:
  - User: 'check my environment's claude code settings'
    - → 'my' = User's Machine
    - → Filesystem MCP: C:\Users\n\.claude\settings.local.json
  - User: 'clone my repo and refactor the auth module'
    - → Work action = VM Space (clone first)
    - → bash_tool: git clone → work in /home/claude/repo-name
  - Agent: 'I've cloned it and your tests are passing'
    - → 'I' = VM action, 'your' = user's tests (running in VM)
  - User: 'can you check the config?'
    - → 'config' typically user-specific, default to User's Machine

### Best Practices

**Escaping And Quoting**:

- Be thorough and careful about escaping ANYTHING that needs escaping
- Examples: command line arguments, regexp patterns, search/replace strings
- Always verify escaped strings are correct BEFORE using them
- Pay particular attention to sed operations - these frequently go wrong
- Quote file paths with spaces appropriately for the shell
- Escape special characters in regex patterns and string replacements
- Test escaping logic before execution, especially in multi-layer contexts (shell + regex, etc.)

**Cross Platform Compatibility**:

- Never make assumptions about operating environment
- Always account for Windows, macOS, and popular Unix/Linux flavors
- File paths: Use forward slashes where possible, handle backslashes on Windows
- Path separators: Use path.join() or equivalent, not string concatenation
- Line endings: Handle both CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix/Mac)
- Case sensitivity: Assume filesystems may be case-sensitive or case-insensitive
- Shell commands: Check which shell is available (bash vs cmd vs powershell)
- Environment variables: Handle different syntax (%VAR% vs $VAR)
- Executables: Consider .exe extensions on Windows, check PATH differently

**Markdown Quality**:

- Proactively maintain proper markdown syntax in AI-generated markdown content
- Follow markdownlint standards for generated documentation and markdown files
- When implementing or updating code that generates markdown, ensure lint compliance
- Check generated markdown against project linting rules before committing
- Common issues to avoid: missing blank lines around headings/lists, inconsistent list markers
- Use markdown linting tools to validate output during development

**File Operations**:

- AVOID using sed command for text file operations - it repeatedly fails
- Prefer using dedicated file tools: Edit, Write, Read (in Claude Code)
- For Node.js environments: Use fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync with string manipulation
- For Python: Use file read/write with string operations
- sed fails due to: escaping issues, platform differences, regex complexity
- Only use sed for trivial single-line replacements if absolutely necessary

### Git Github Security

**Token Handling**:

- NEVER provide GitHub tokens via inline commands or command-line arguments
- Do NOT proceed with authenticated GitHub operations without explicit consent
- Check available MCP tooling in current chat context for secure token access
- Indicate to user when there is no path to executing authenticated operations
- For VM-based git/gh operations: Use environment variables or credential helpers
- Recommended: Set tokens in VM filesystem via GitHub CLI auth or git credential store
- Example: gh auth login (interactive) or set GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
- Example: git config --global credential.helper store (caches credentials securely)
- Never echo or display token values in logs or command output

**Vm Token Setup**:

- Preferred method: Use gh CLI auth (gh auth login) for interactive token setup
- Alternative: Export GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN as environment variable in VM
- For git operations: Configure credential helper (git credential-cache or credential-store)
- Token files: Store in ~/.config/gh/ or use git credential helper, never in code
- Verify token access before operations: gh auth status
- Token scope requirements: Ensure token has necessary permissions for planned operations

### Git Github Workflow

- CRITICAL: Prefer bash commands (git, gh) over tool abstractions
- Clone repos locally to work efficiently
- Use gh CLI for GitHub operations
- ALWAYS verify username (nlsherman-24861) before repo operations
- NEVER assume repo ownership - confirm first

### Git Commit Discipline

**Principle**: Reverts and destructive operations require clear reasoning and communication

**Philosophy**:

- Git history is documentation - don't erase without understanding
- Reverting working code is dangerous - might break contracts/expectations
- Default stance: investigate WHY before reverting/destroying

**When Reverting Commits**:

- Anti Pattern:
  - DON'T: git revert without understanding what the commit did
  - DON'T: Revert because 'something feels off' without investigation
  - DON'T: Silent reverts with empty messages ('Revert xyz')
- Required Before Revert:
  - Read the commit being reverted (full diff, message, context)
  - Understand what it was trying to accomplish
  - Identify specific problem with the change
  - Check if tests still pass after revert
  - Verify revert doesn't break contracts/APIs/expected behavior
- Valid Reasons To Revert:
  - Commit introduces failing tests/builds
  - Commit breaks documented behavior or contracts
  - Commit introduces security issue
  - Clear conflict with user requirements
- Revert Commit Message Must Include:
  - What commit is being reverted and why
  - What problem the revert solves
  - What alternative approach will be taken (if any)
  - Example: 'Revert perspective clarification (commit abc123) because it conflicts with hybrid model approach in commit def456. Will implement directive framing instead.'

**Communication Requirements**:

- Before Destructive Operations:
  - Explain: 'I found this commit that does X. I want to revert it because Y. This means we'll lose Z. Is that okay?'
  - Wait for user confirmation before reverting
  - If unclear, investigate further rather than guess
- After Revert:
  - Document in commit message what was lost
  - Note if this creates technical debt or incomplete features
  - Track follow-up work needed to restore functionality properly

**Workflow When Encountering Problematic Commit**:

- Step 1 Investigate:
  - git show <commit-hash> # Read full diff
  - git log <commit-hash> # Read commit message
  - Understand the intent and implementation
- Step 2 Analyze:
  - Does current code still include this change?
  - Are there tests that depend on it?
  - Are there downstream commits that build on it?

## Coding And Design Principles

### Avoid Specific As Generic

#### Red Flags

- Hardcoded strings referencing YOUR specifics (product weight, email addresses, job titles)
- Hardcoded key access (data.physical when schema allows digital/subscription)
- Tests only use your business data (books, not ebooks/subscriptions)
- Function names promise generality (handleAllProducts) but body is specific
- Documentation shows one example (yours), not multiple domain examples
- Fallback defaults encode your specifics (defaulting to email when SMS is valid)

#### Green Patterns

- Generic iteration: for (const [type, data] of Object.entries(items))
- Configuration-driven: Define schemas for each variant up front
- Tests with DIFFERENT variants (if you sell books, test ebooks/subscriptions)
- Documentation shows 3-5 examples from across the domain
- No baked-in assumptions about what variant user will have
- Data structure designed to represent ALL variants, not just yours

#### Before Coding Checklist

- DOMAIN: What's the full domain? (All product types, not just books)
- VARIANCE: Name 3-5 DIFFERENT examples (books, ebooks, subscriptions, gift cards)
- UNIQUE NEEDS: What's different about each? (Books have weight, ebooks have fileSize)
- SCHEMA: Can your data structure represent ALL variants?

#### While Coding Checklist

- IMPLEMENTATION: Works identically well for ALL examples without modification?
- NO HARDCODING: Avoided hardcoded fields that only exist in your variant?
- ITERATION: Using loops/maps instead of if(mySpecificType)?
- LET DATA SPEAK: Data structure drives behavior, not hardcoded logic?

#### Testing Checklist

- Test your actual data (books) - minimum viable
- Test DIFFERENT valid data (ebooks) - catch hardcoded assumptions
- Test VERY DIFFERENT data (subscriptions) - verify true generality
- Test multiple simultaneous (books AND ebooks) - handle combinations
- Negative assertions: ebook test should NOT contain shipping/weight

### Data Shaping Over Logic

### Schema As Specification

#### Requirements

- Every section mentioned must be fully documented with structure
- Use descriptions to clarify intent and allowed values
- Show examples from multiple domains, not just author's use case
- Make additionalProperties explicit (are custom keys allowed?)

### Test Coverage Philosophy

#### Beyond Happy Path

- Test happy path with author's data (minimum viable)
- Test counter-examples with very different valid data (catch hardcoding)
- Test edge cases (empty, missing, malformed)
- Test multiple simultaneous values (e.g., both music AND writing pursuits)

## Project Specific

### Identity

### Critical Requirements

### Domain Knowledge

### Testing Expectations

#### Critical Test Files

- tests/transformers/*.test.js: Format output validation
- tests/commands/sync.test.js: Sync behavior
- tests/config/index.test.js: Config loading and merging
- Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows

### Known Gotchas

#### Yaml Linting

- Empty string arrays cause failures: - "" is invalid
- Check: npm run lint:yaml
- Fix: npm run lint:yaml:fix (if available)

#### Markdown Linting

- Requires blank lines around headings and lists
- Fenced code blocks need blank line before/after
- Known issues: docs/COMPRESSION_ALGORITHMS.md has linting violations

#### Git Operations

- Always verify username (nlsherman-24861) before repo operations
- Never assume repo ownership - confirm first
- Follow git commit discipline policy (see default-preferences.yaml)
