# Claude Context Sync - Workspace Configuration
#
# Place this file as `.claude-sync-workspace` in your repos directory
# (default: ~/repos) to configure workspace-wide settings for bulk marking.
#
# This file is loaded when running `mark --bulk` and allows you to
# persistently exclude repositories from bulk operations.

# Exclude specific repositories by name or pattern
# Supports simple glob patterns: * matches any characters
exclude:
  # Exclude specific repos
  - archived-project
  - legacy-app

  # Exclude patterns - all repos starting with 'test-'
  - test-*

  # Exclude patterns - all repos ending with '-backup'
  - "*-backup"

  # Exclude patterns - repos containing 'demo'
  - "*demo*"

# Examples:
# - foo: Excludes repo named exactly "foo"
# - test-*: Excludes all repos starting with "test-"
# - *-backup: Excludes all repos ending with "-backup"
# - *temp*: Excludes all repos containing "temp"

# Note: You can also use --exclude flag directly on the command line:
#   claude-context-sync mark --bulk --user yourname --exclude archived-* temp-*
#
# Both workspace config and CLI flags are combined.
