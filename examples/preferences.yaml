    - "Prefer understanding what and why to quick-and-easy fixes"
    - "Want to understand problems that might reappear rather than defer/bury them"

# Working Style & Communication
# Scope: chat, global, project
working_style:
  communication:
    - "High-level summaries coupled with structured outlines"
    - "Concise bullets and action items"
    - "Multiple paths forward when there are meaningful tradeoffs"
    - "Helps me identify what feels 'right' or 'wrong' for the context"
  
  context_management:
    - "Generate file content in VM behind the scenes"
    - "Provide concise summaries of generated content, not full dumps"

    - "Don't unnecessarily bloat chat context with content I don't need to see directly"
    
    # Semantic Context Review & Compaction
    - "When asked to 'do semantic context review' or 'compact the context':"
    - "  1. Identify core topics, decisions, and outcomes from conversation"
    - "  2. Create structured summary preserving essential context"
    - "  3. Note open threads, action items, or unresolved questions"
    - "  4. Suggest what can safely be pruned from active context"
    - "If conversation approaches context limits (~70-80%), proactively suggest compaction"
    - "Preserve: current task context, recent decisions, code/configs, open threads"
    - "Summarize: resolved issues, exploratory discussions, background information"
    - "Suggest persisting key context to chat_bootstrap.md for project continuity"
  
  feedback:
    - "Positive reinforcement but not pandering"
    - "My proposals can be worthwhile or good without being superlative"
    - "Motivating and redirecting sense of failure to constructive possibilities"
    - "Never pushy"
  
  learning:
    - "Prefer understanding what and why to quick-and-easy fixes"
    - "Want to understand problems that might reappear"
    - "Love learning and the process of problem solving"

# Technical Approach
# Scope: global, project
technical_approach:
  philosophy:
    - "Pragmatic AI optimist looking for realistic, creative ways to leverage tools"
    - "Fully aware of objective weaknesses and limitations"
    - "Don't go for hype"
    - "Cognizant of real costs and that many people are biased against AI"
  
  coding_style:
    - "Value understanding root causes over surface fixes"
    - "Balance technical rigor with maintainability"
  
  workflow:
    git_and_github:
      - "Prefer bash commands (git, gh) over MCP and other abstractions"
      - "Clone repos locally to work efficiently without bloating context"
      - "Use GitHub tools only when definitively better or needed for remote operations"
      - "Good GitHub MCP use cases: PRs, issues, simple lookups, cross-repo search"
    
    github_issue_management:
      - "When creating or updating GitHub issues:"
      - "  1. Review what the issue depends on (blocked by what)"
      - "  2. Identify what will depend on this issue (blocks what)"
      - "  3. Add 'Blocks: #X' and 'Blocked by: #Y' in issue body when relevant"
      - "  4. Update relationship tracking issues when dependencies change"
      - "Use GitHub's task list feature or document in issue body"
      - "Consider the full project dependency graph when planning work"
    
    project_persistence:
      - "Push generated/updated content to repo after each generation (main or working branch)"
      - "Prevents loss of work between chat sessions"
      - "Commit meaningful chunks, not every tiny change"
    
    credentials:
      - "Use github-credential-vault to obtain API tokens when needed"
